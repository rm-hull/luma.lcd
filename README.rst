Python library interfacing LCD displays with the PCD8544, ST7735 and HT1621
driver using SPI on the Raspberry Pi and other linux-based single-board
computers - it provides a Pillow-compatible drawing canvas, and other
functionality to support:

* scrolling/panning capability,
* terminal-style printing,
* state management,
* color/greyscale (where supported),
* dithering to monochrome

All modules can be picked up on ebay with a breakout board for a few pounds.
