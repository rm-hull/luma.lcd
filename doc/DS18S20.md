Dallas Semiconductors DS18S20 temperature sensor
================================================

Load the one-wire drivers:

    $ sudo modprobe w1-gpio
    $ sudo modprobe w1-therm

Next check to make sure the drivers loaded successfully:

    $ dmesg | grep w1_master
    [  314.560266] w1_master_driver w1_bus_master1: Family 28 for 28.00000453e135.c1 is not registered.

Then interrogate the bus, noting that the serial number from above (and
that the dot is changed to a dash):

    $ cd /sys/bus/w1/devices/28-00000453e135
    $ cat w1_slave
    84 01 4b 46 7f ff 0c 10 72 : crc=72 YES
    84 01 4b 46 7f ff 0c 10 72 t=24250

This reads off as a temperature of 24.250Â°C.
